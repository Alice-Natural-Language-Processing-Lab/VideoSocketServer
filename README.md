# VideoSocketServer
Streaming WebCam video, over a TCP socket connection, between UWP Apps in C#

The server and client must run on different machines.
I deploy the server to a Raspberry Pi 2, running Windows IOT and the app on either the Local Machine, or a Windows 10 Mobile (Emulator will work too).
