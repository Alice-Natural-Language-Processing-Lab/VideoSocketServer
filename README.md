# VideoSocketServer
Streaming WebCam video, over a TCP socket connection, between UWP Apps in C#

The server and client must run on different machines.
I run the server on a Raspberry Pi 2, under the Windows IOT platform, and the client as either a Windows 10 Desktop App, or a Windows 10 Mobile App.
